# SecureVault2019-1

Today many among us have one psasword for every account we have, or few passwords which we cant remember and write them in unsecure places. 
The application gives a solution just for that. 
SecureVault require to remember only the applicatoin password. 
The user then can save all his different passwords by categories. 
The passwords which the user is save, are all encrypted so even if some one managed to put his hands on the database, he still could not get the user's passwords.
